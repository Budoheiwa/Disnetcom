# REQUIREMENTS
Before using the PCAP parser project, you need some requirements:
  - Install Kali Linux OS
  - Make sure that all is update with the command: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
 > Especially the Python language
  - To be sure that **_Python has the best version_**, you can see its version with `$ which python3` in the **_terminal_**
  - Install docker with the command `sudo apt install -y docker.io && sudo systemctl enable docker --now`
> Now you can get started with using docker, with sudo.
  - If you want to add yourself to the docker group to use docker without sudo, an additional step is needed: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`.
> The final thing is to **_logout and in again_**
